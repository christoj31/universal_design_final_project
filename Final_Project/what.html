            Universal Design in a critical topic and understanding it can be complex because of the incredible applications and sheer number of people who may benefit.

            <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
              Universal design is commonly defined as the design and composition of environments, products, and 
              communications so they can be accessed, understood, and used to the greatest extent possible 
              by all people, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. It applies to physical spaces, 
              digital interfaces, and services. In education, it also informs frameworks like Universal Design 
              for Learning, which encourage multiple ways of engaging with content, representing information, 
              and demonstrating learning.

              <li>Emphasizes flexibility in how people access, interact with, and contribute to environments and content.</li>
              <li>Encourages “designing for the edges” by considering users with the most diverse needs, which often improves the experience for everyone.</li>
              <li>Can be applied at different scales, from a single web form or classroom activity to a whole campus, product line, or transit system.</li>
              <li>Influences policies and procedures, such as how information is communicated, how feedback is collected, and how support is provided.</li>

            <h3 style="text-align: left; padding: 20px;">Incorperating HTML5:</h3>
            <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
              HTML5 provides semantic elements that support universal design by giving structure and meaning to content.
              This helps both users and assistive technologies. Using elements like header, nav, main, article, 
              section, and footer clarifies page regions, while form attributes, labels, and native controls 
                improve keyboard and screen reader access. Combined with responsive design techniques and accessible 
                media, semantic HTML5 is a foundation for universally designed web experiences.
            </h4>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <li>Use <label> elements, descriptive button text, and meaningful link phrases so users understand actions without relying only on visual cues.</li>
              <li>Mark up lists, tables, quotes, and forms with appropriate HTML elements instead of using visual styling alone to suggest structure.</li>
              <li>Ensure focus order and tabbing follow the visual reading order, so keyboard users can navigate predictably.</li>
              <li>Pair semantic HTML with CSS and responsive design techniques so content reflows gracefully on phones, tablets, and large screens.</li>
            </ul>
