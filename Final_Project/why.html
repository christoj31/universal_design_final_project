          <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 35px;">
            The importance of Universal Design cannot be underestimated. It's rooted in the idea that inclusion is a basic 
            human right and not a special feature.
          </h3>

          <h4 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 80px;">The "WHY?" behind universal design is hard to encompass fully but 2 major reasons behind it are <a href="#Ethics" style="color:brown">Ethics</a> & <a href="#BOU" style="color:brown">Benefits of Use</a></h4>

          <div id="Ethics" style="border: 4px solid white; border-radius: 30px;">
            <h3 style="text-align: left; padding: 20px;">Ethics:</h3>
            <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
              Designing for the broadest range of users shows respect for people’s dignity and diversity by removing 
              unnecessary barriers before they exclude someone. Instead of asking people to request “accommodations”, 
              universal design shifts responsibility to designers, educators, and organizations to anticipate different 
              bodies, minds, and contexts from the start.
            </h4>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <li>Treats disability and difference as a normal part of human diversity rather than a problem to “fix.”</li>
              <li>Encourages shared responsibility across designers, administrators, educators, and developers instead of placing the burden on individual users to ask for help.</li>
              <li>Reduces stigma by making inclusive features standard and visible for everyone, not hidden as “special” add ons.</li>
              <li>Helps institutions move beyond basic legal compliance towards a proactive culture of respect, equity, and social justice.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="BOU" style="border: 4px solid white; border-radius: 30px; margin-top: 60px;">
            <h3 style="text-align: left; padding: 20px;">Benefits of Use:</h3>
            <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">
              Universal design benefits everyone not just people who identify as disabled or who currently need 
              accommodations. With features like clear structure and readable text new language learners, mobile users, and many others 
              can help in everyday situations. When universal design is integrated early, it often reduces long term costs by 
              minimizing changes and support overhead while expanding who can successfully use everydays things.

            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <li>Improves overall usability, leading to faster task completion, fewer errors, and higher satisfaction for a wide range of users.</li>
              <li>Supports changing needs over time, such as temporary injuries, aging, or new technologies, without requiring major redesigns.</li>
              <li>Expands audience reach by making spaces, products, and content usable for more people, which can increase enrollment, traffic, or revenue.</li>
